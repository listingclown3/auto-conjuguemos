# website
[test website](http://152.67.232.156:6969/conjuguemos)

this is a testing website or a production environment, but will be kept on for people who do not want to self host

it should be noted that if attacks are sent, I will consider taking down the site permanently, but I may install tighter security. 

in any case, enjoy the free production website, it runs identical code (which hopefully won't be my downfall) and stores ZERO user data, cheers!
